<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Work requirements are common in U.S. safety net programs. Evidence remains limited, however, on the extent to which work requirements increase economic self-sufficiency or screen out vulnerable individuals. Using linked administrative data on food stamps (SNAP) and earnings with a regression discontinuity design, we find robust evidence that work requirements increase program exits by 23 percentage points (64 percent) among incumbent participants. Overall program participation among adults who are subject to work requirements is reduced by 53 percent. Homeless adults are disproportionately screened out. We find no effects on employment, and suggestive evidence of increased earnings in some specifications.</p>

<h2>Other relevant experience</h2>

<p>During the summer of 2021, Stephanie Kestelman and I organized a <b>Causal Inference "Bootcamp"</b> for Harvard PhD students. For our meetings, graduate students review causal inference strategies, present state-of-the-art applied papers, and write code in R or Stata to implement the designs. </p>

<p>During the summer of 2020, I organized an <b>econometrics reading group</b> for Harvard PhD students with the guidance of Professors Isaiah Andrews and Elie Tamer. Other graduate students helped select and present papers. See this link for <a href="files/Econometrics_Reading_Group.pdf">applied and theory schedules</a>.</p>

<p>I was a teaching assistant for a Master of Public Policy <b>course on Impact Evaluation</b> taught by Professor Sally Hudson at the University of Virginia's Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. The course covered econometric approaches to policy analysis, including experiments, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and panel data methods. Assignments required students to replicate analyses from policy-relevant economics journal articles.</p>
