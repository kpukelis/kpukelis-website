<h3>SNAP Work Requirements and Labor Supply</h3>
<h4>with Colin Gray, Adam Leive, Elena Prager, and Mary Zaki</h4>

<p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) imposes time limits on able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) who do not comply with work requirements. We are interested in empirically studying the effects of these work requirements on labor market outcomes.</p>
  
<h3>"Ferguson Effect" on Gun Violence?</h3>
<h4>with Jennifer Doleac</h4>

<p>Around 2014, several deaths of black men at the hands of police officers and ensuing protests made national news. Among the most publicized events were the August 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri following the death of Michael Brown. Did the increased scrutiny of police during this period lead to a violent crime wave &mdash; the so-called "Ferguson effect"? We hope to investigate this question using data on gunfire available across several American cities.</p>

<div id="other"></div>
<h2>Other relevant experience</h2>

<p>I was a teaching assistant for a Master of Public Policy course on Impact Evaluation taught by Professor Sally Hudson at the University of Virginia's Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. The course covered econometric approaches to policy analysis, including experiments, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and panel data methods. Assignments required students to replicate analyses from policy-relevant economics journal articles.</p>
