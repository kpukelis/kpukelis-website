<h3>SNAP Work Requirements for ABAWDs</h3>
<h4>with Colin Gray, Adam Leive, Elena Prager, and Mary Zaki</h4>

<p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) imposes time limits on able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) who do not comply with work requirements. We are interested in empirically studying the effects of these work requirements on labor market outcomes.</p>
  
<p><strong>My role:</strong> I have performed background research on SNAP policies. I have also written the Stata code to process administrative data on SNAP program records and have begun implementing regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference analyses.</p>

<h3>Mandatory Reporting of Sexual Assaults on College Campuses</h3>
<h4>with Jennifer Doleac</h4>

<p>Title IX is the federal statue that prohibits sex-based discrimination by educational institutions that receive federal funding. Following new Title IX guidance issued in the early 2010's, colleges and universities instituted policies which require faculty, staff, and often other employees to report incidents of sexual assault that they become aware of. We are interested in studying the effect of these policies on reports of sexual assault on college campuses.</p>

<p><strong>My role:</strong> I am gathering information on these policies from universities. I am also analyzing administrative crime data using a difference-in-difference approach.</p>

<h3>"Ferguson Effect" on Gun Violence?</h3>
<h4>with Jennifer Doleac</h4>

<p>Around 2014, several deaths of black men at the hands of police officers and ensuing protests made national news. Among the most publicized events were the August 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri following the death of Michael Brown. Did the increased scrutiny of police during this period lead to a violent crime wave &mdash; the so-called "Ferguson effect"? We hope to investigate this question using data on gunfire available across several American cities.</p>

<p><strong>My role:</strong> I have reviewed the current literature and am analyzing the data.</p>

<h2>Other relevant experience</h2>

<p>I was a teaching assistant for a Master of Public Policy course on Impact Evaluation taught by Professor Sally Hudson at the University of Virginia's Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. The course covered econometric approaches to policy analysis, including experiments, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and panel data methods. Assignments required students to replicate analyses from the following journal articles:</p>
