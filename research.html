<h3><a href="files/SNAP_Work_Requirements.pdf">Employed in a SNAP? The Impact of Work Requirements on Program Participation and Labor Supply</a></h3>
<h4>with Colin Gray, Adam Leive, Elena Prager, and Mary Zaki</h4>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Work requirements are common in many U.S. safety net programs. Evidence remains limited, however, on whether work requirements increase economic self-sufficiency or screen out vulnerable individuals. Using linked administrative data on food stamps (SNAP) and earnings with a regression discontinuity design, we find that work requirements reduce SNAP participation by 52 percent. Very low-income and homeless adults are disproportionately screened out. We statistically rule out employment increases of more than 2 percentage points. We find evidence of increased earnings near a key eligibility threshold, and provide conditions under which this trade-off improves or reduces welfare.

<h3>"Ferguson Effect" on Gun Violence?</h3>
<h4>with Jennifer Doleac</h4>

<p>Around 2014, several deaths of black men at the hands of police officers and ensuing protests made national news. Among the most publicized events were the August 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri following the death of Michael Brown. Did the increased scrutiny of police during this period lead to a violent crime wave &mdash; the so-called "Ferguson effect"? We hope to investigate this question using data on gunfire available across several American cities.</p>

<h2>Other relevant experience</h2>

<p>I was a teaching assistant for a Master of Public Policy course on Impact Evaluation taught by Professor Sally Hudson at the University of Virginia's Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. The course covered econometric approaches to policy analysis, including experiments, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and panel data methods. Assignments required students to replicate analyses from policy-relevant economics journal articles.</p>
