<h3><a href="files/SNAP_Work_Requirements.pdf">Employed in a SNAP? The Impact of Work Requirements on Program Participation and Labor Supply</a></h3>
<h4>with Colin Gray, Adam Leive, Elena Prager, and Mary Zaki</h4>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Work requirements are common in U.S. safety net programs. Evidence remains limited, however, on the extent to which work requirements increase economic self-sufficiency or screen out vulnerable individuals. We use linked administrative data on food stamps (SNAP) and earnings to study the effects of work requirements on program participation and labor market outcomes. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that work requirements reduce retention of existing program beneficiaries by 38 percent and reduce overall SNAP participation by 52 percent. Very low-income and homeless adults are disproportionately screened out. We fail to find evidence of improvements in economic self-sufficiency among the majority of the sample. Our estimates statistically rule out average employment increases of more than 2 percentage points. We do find evidence of increased earnings along a small portion of the earnings distribution near a key eligibility threshold. Finally, we provide conditions under which SNAP work requirements are efficient with respect to the marginal value of public funds.</p>

<h2>Other relevant experience</h2>

<p>I am organizing an <b>econometrics reading group</b> for Harvard PhD students with the guidance of Professors Isaiah Andrews and Elie Tamer. Other graduate students help select and present papers. See this link for <a href="files/Econometrics_Reading_Group.pdf">applied and theory schedules</a>.</p>

<p>I was a teaching assistant for a Master of Public Policy course on Impact Evaluation taught by Professor Sally Hudson at the University of Virginia's Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. The course covered econometric approaches to policy analysis, including experiments, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and panel data methods. Assignments required students to replicate analyses from policy-relevant economics journal articles.</p>
