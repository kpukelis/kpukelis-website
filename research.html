<h2>Work in Progress</h2>

<h3>Wage insurance for Displaced Workers (with Brian Kovak, Benjamin Hyman, Adam Leive)</h3>

<p>Trade and automation have led to substantial job loss in recent decades. Wage insurance is a policy option to financially protect displaced workers because it pays for a fraction of the wages lost when a worker is laid off and subsequently takes a lower-paying job. We are interested in studying the effect of wage insurance on labor market outcomes using a regression discontinuity design.</p>

<p>NSF project page<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1851679&HistoricalAwards=false"></a></p>

<p><strong>My role:</strong> I have written the Stata code to process restricted-access, administrative data on wage insurance program records, wages, and social services receipts and I have implemented the regression discontinuity analysis.</p>

<h3>SNAP time limits (with Adam Leive)</h3>

<p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) imposes time limits for receiving benefits on able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). During times of economic hardship, however, these limits can be waived. Exploiting this variation, we hope to explore how social service time limits affect labor market behavior.</p>
  
<p><strong>My role:</strong> I have performed background research on SNAP policies. I have also written the Stata code to process large administrative data on SNAP program records and have begun implementing the regression discontinuity analysis.</p>

<h3>Mandatory Reporting of Sexual Assaults on College Campuses (with Jennifer Doleac)</h3>

<p>Title IX is the federal statue that prohibits sex-based discrimination by educational institutions that receive federal funding. Following new rules issued in 2014, colleges and universities instituted policies which require faculty, staff, and sometimes even student employees to report incidents of sexual assault that they become aware of. We are interested in studying the effect of these policies on students' reports of sexual assault.</p>

<p><strong>My role:</strong> I am gathering information on these policies from universities.</p>

<h3>"Ferguson Effect" on Gun Violence? (with Jennifer Doleac)</h3>

<p>Around 2014, several deaths of black men at the hands of police officers and ensuing protests made national news. Among the most publicized events were the August 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri following the death of Michael Brown. Did the increased scrutiny of police during this period lead to a violent crime wave? That is, was there a "Ferguson effect"? We hope to investigate this question using data on gunfire available across several American cities.</p>

<p><strong>My role:</strong> I have reviewed the current literature and am analyzing the data.</p>
