<h3>Mandatory Reporting of Sexual Assaults on College Campuses</h3>
<h4>with Jennifer Doleac</h4>

<p>Title IX is the federal statue that prohibits sex-based discrimination by educational institutions that receive federal funding. Following new Title IX guidance issued in the early 2010's, colleges and universities instituted policies which require faculty, staff, and often other employees to report incidents of sexual assault that they become aware of. We are interested in studying the effect of these policies on reports of sexual assault on college campuses.</p>
