      <h2></h2>
      <p>I am a Ph.D. student in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School with fields in public and labor economics. I am interested in the design of government transfer programs, private forms of redistribution, and governments' involvement in labor markets. I am also interested in applied econometrics and behavioral economics. I am a James M. and Cathleen D. Stone PhD Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration in Harvard University's Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality & Social Policy and an awardee of the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program. During the summer of 2020, I worked as a Research Intern at Microsoft Research New England. Prior to graduate school, I was a Research Specialist Intermediate at the University of Virginia's Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. In 2017, I earned a B.A. with honors in Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences, Economics, and Mathematics from Northwestern University.  </p>
