      <h2></h2>
      <p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in <font color="#b31d28">Public Policy</font> at the <font color="#b31d28">Harvard Kennedy School</font>. I am an <font color="#b31d28">empirical public economist</font> studying <font color="#b31d28">U.S. social safety net policy</font>.
        <!--, with secondary fields in <font color="#b31d28">labor and behavioral economics</font>.-->
         <!--I am particularly interested in the relationship between the <font color="#b31d28">social safety net and work</font>.-->
         My current research focuses on the <font color="#b31d28">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</font> (SNAP or food stamps), including the impacts of work requirements, online grocery shopping, and stigma. 
        <!--: the largest nutrition assistance program in the U.S. I -->
        <!--I have studied the impact of <font color="#b31d28">work requirements</font> on employment and earnings, and I am currently studying the effects of drastic administrative <font color="#b31d28">changes to SNAP since the COVID-19 pandemic</font> and the nature of <font color="#b31d28">stigma</font> associated with the program.--> 
        I primarily apply <font color="#b31d28">quasi-experimental methods</font> to publicly available and administrative data. I also design <font color="#b31d28">surveys and experiments</font> to understand people's beliefs and attitudes about social issues. 
        <!-- I also run surveys to describ and run surveys to describe.--> 
        <!-- More broadly, I am also interested in <font color="#b31d28">applied econometric methods</font> and the effect of <font color="#b31d28">social norms and pressures</font> on individual behavior.-->
        By acquiring deep contextual knowledge and applying insights from other social sciences into economics, my goal is to deepen our understanding of the <font color="#b31d28">consequences of policy design choices</font> in part by incorporating the perspective of individuals who are affected by them. </p>
       <p>
At Harvard, I am a PhD Scholar in the <a href="https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu/">James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Program in Wealth Distribution, Inequality, and Social Policy</a>, and an affiliate of the <a href="https://socialeconomicslab.org/">Social Economics Lab</a> and the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/">Institute for Quantitative Social Science</a>.</p>
<p>
I am also an alumna of the <a href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/project/the-mosaic-project/about/">Mosaic Economic Project</a>, which provides training in policy communication for women in economics and technology. In 2019, I was awarded a <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship</a>.</p>
       <p>During the summer of 2020, I worked as a Research Intern at 
        <font color="#b31d28">Microsoft Research New England</font>. Prior to graduate school, I was a <!--Research Specialist Intermediate--> full-time research assistant at the <font color="#b31d28">University of Virginia's Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy</font>. In 2017, I earned a B.A. with honors in Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences, Economics, and Mathematics from <font color="#b31d28">Northwestern University</font>.</p>
