      <h2></h2>
      <p>I am a Ph.D. student in <font color="#b31d28">Public Policy</font> at the <font color="#b31d28">Harvard Kennedy School</font>. I am an <font color="#b31d28">empirical public economist</font>, with secondary fields in <font color="#b31d28">labor and behavioral economics</font>. I am particularly interested in the relationship between the <font color="#b31d28">social safety net and work</font>. My current research focuses on the <font color="#b31d28">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</font>: the largest nutrition assistance program in the U.S. I have studied the impact of <font color="#b31d28">work requirements</font> on employment and earnings, and I am currently studying the effects of drastic administrative <font color="#b31d28">changes to SNAP since the COVID-19 pandemic</font> and the nature of <font color="#b31d28">stigma</font> associated with the program. I primarily apply <font color="#b31d28">quasi-experimental methods</font> to publicly available and administrative data. More broadly, I am also interested in <font color="#b31d28">applied econometric methods</font> and the effect of <font color="#b31d28">social norms and pressures</font> on individual behavior. By acquiring deep contextual knowledge and applying insights from other social sciences into economics, my goal is to deepen our understanding of the <font color="#b31d28">consequences of policy design choices</font> in part by incorporating the perspective of individuals who are affected by them. </p>
       <p>I am a James M. and Cathleen D. Stone PhD Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration in Harvard University's Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality & Social Policy and an awardee of the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program. During the summer of 2020, I worked as a Research Intern at Microsoft Research New England. Prior to graduate school, I was a Research Specialist Intermediate at the University of Virginia's Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. In 2017, I earned a B.A. with honors in Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences, Economics, and Mathematics from Northwestern University.  </p>
